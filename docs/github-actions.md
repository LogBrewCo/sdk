# GitHub Actions Guide

This repository should start with GitHub-hosted Actions rather than custom runners or local-machine publishing.

## Why this is the better default

- Clean, reproducible builds on every pull request
- Public, reviewable release steps
- Minimal operational overhead
- Protected environments and approval gates when publishing
- Trusted publishing or OIDC support where registries allow it

## Workflow layout

- `ci.yml`: runs on every push to `main` and every pull request
- `release-readiness.yml`: runs manually or on version tags and performs package dry-runs only for ecosystems detected in the repository

## Best practices

- Keep default permissions minimal with `contents: read`
- Separate normal CI from release-oriented checks
- Use concurrency to cancel stale CI runs on the same branch
- Run contract tests before ecosystem-specific dry-runs
- Detect manifests and skip irrelevant jobs instead of failing empty repos
- Prefer trusted publishing or OIDC over long-lived registry tokens
- Add protected environments before any real publish job is enabled
- Pin explicit hosted toolchain setup for every supported ecosystem instead of relying on whatever `ubuntu-latest` happens to preinstall
- If a real-user smoke script exercises `pnpm` or `yarn`, enable Corepack before the smoke step even when the repo itself does not check in that package manager's lockfile
- Keep local and CI release-readiness checks aligned: if local smoke tests install packaged artifacts, CI should continue to exercise those same artifact-oriented paths
- Prefer verifiers with a machine-readable summary mode so CI and automation can consume pass/fail plus step metadata without scraping logs

## What to do next

1. Enable branch protection for `main` and require the `CI / Contract checks` job.
2. Add protected GitHub environments for each registry publish target before enabling publish jobs.
3. When a real SDK package lands, extend `release-readiness.yml` with the package's install/build/test steps before any publish action.
4. Add publish workflows only after dry-runs are consistently green.
